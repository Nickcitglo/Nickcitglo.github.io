     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>
       Nekhel, my name, isn't as common as I thought. It's a special gift from my mother and grandmother, chosen because they believed it suited me, a name I wear with pride since birth. Little did I know, my name carries a hidden meaning, a story waiting to be discovered.
       <br><br>
       Nekhel is an Anglo-Saxon name; my dad told me he wanted it to be strong like a Viking. The name symbolizes strength and legacy, and it resonates with me because I want my name, Nekhel Mckella, to be remembered. Whenever I go through hard times, I remember my dad named me Nekhel because he wants me to be mentally tough and never let people get to me.
       <br><br>
       At first, I assumed it was ordinary, possibly even shared by many. This belief stemmed from my knowledge that it's also the name of a city in Egypt, which intrigued me and added uniqueness to my identity.
       <br><br>
       Then there's my first middle name, Addie. It was initially meant to be my first name, a choice my father had in mind. However, my mother had different thoughts, and so it became my middle name. The origin and significance of Addie remained a mystery to me, until I discovered it meant "nobility."
       <br><br>
       Nyeem, my second middle name, was given by my grandmother. Interestingly, it's also the name of one of my cousins. I had always regarded it as a common name, though it felt more like a first name. Later, I learned that in Arabic, Nyeem (with an extra letter) means happiness and comfort.

     <h1>Where I Call Home</h1>
     <p>
       I was born and raised in Queens, New York, my entire life. I haven't moved away from the city before but I have moved to different locations within it. Growing up, I lived with my mother, aunties, cousins, grandma, and grandpa.
       <br><br>
       I had a friend who lived across the street from my auntie's house, and we became very close. We played together, rode bikes, and spent many afternoons outside. Eventually, he moved away, and I felt his absence deeply. My cousins also went to schools in different states, leaving me a bit isolated until they came back on breaks.
       <br><br>
       Hollis Ave and Jamaica Avenue were my childhood streets. I remember the ice cream truck coming around after school and the warm summer days spent outside.
